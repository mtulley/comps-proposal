	abstract = {The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have inspired recent efforts to integrate LLM-generated dialogue into video games. However, evaluation remains a major challenge: how do we assess the player experience in a commercial game augmented with LLM-generated dialogue? To explore this question, we introduce a dynamic evaluation framework for the dialogue management systems that govern the task-oriented dialogue often found in roleplaying video games. We first extract dialogue from the widely-acclaimed role-playing game *Disco Elysium: The Final Cut*, which contains 1.1M words of dialogue spread across a complex graph of utterances where node reachability depends on game state (e.g., whether a certain item is held). Using this dataset, we have GPT-4 perform *dialogue infilling* to generate grounded utterances based on game state represented via code. In a statistically robust study of 28 players recruited from the r/DiscoyElysium subreddit, the LLM outputs are evaluated against the game designers' writing via both preference judgments and free-form feedback using a web interface that recreates the game`s core conversation functionality. Overall, the game designers' prose is significantly preferred to GPT-4 generations, with participants citing reasons such as improved logical flow and grounding with the game state. To spur more principled future research in this area, we release our web interface and tools to enable researchers to build upon our work. https://pl.aiwright.dev},

One application domain that could prove fruitful is to video games, where LLMs could be used to provide conversational responses from non-playable characters (NPCs) that are more dynamic and diverse. Additionally, LLMs could allow players the autonomy to converse in open-ended conversations potentially improving player immersion and agency. However, due to their recent commercial popularity, the consequences (both negative and positive) of using LLMs in video games from a player’s perspective is currently unclear. On from this, we analyse player feedback to the use of LLM-driven NPC responses in a commercially available video game.

We developed a murder mystery game where users interact with LLM-based non-playable characters (NPCs) through interrogation, clue-gathering, and exploration. Two versions were tested: one using speech recognition and another with traditional dialog boxes. While both provided similar social presence, users felt more immersed with speech recognition but found it overwhelming, while the dialog version was more challenging.

Tutkimuksen tavoitteisiin kuului kehittää mukautuvia ja asiayhteyden ymmärtäviä NPC-hahmoja, mitata NPC-hahmojen kykyä ylläpitää immersiota, LLM:ien vaikutusta tarinaan ja NPC-hahmojen uskottavuuteen, mitata laskennallisia ja taloudellisia kustannuksia, mitata dialogin generoinnin viivettä sekä vähentää NPC-dialogien hallusinaatioita.

Tutkimuksessa käytettiin Design Science Research (DSR) -metodologiaa, jossa ensiksi tunnistettiin ongelma ja seuraavaksi artefaktien suunnittelulla ja arvioinnilla. Järjestelmäarkkitehtuuri sisälsi tiedonkulun ja -hallinnan, hakujärjestelmät ja generointijärjestelmät, tietojen säilyttämisen ja haun. Arviointityökalut integroitiin mittaamaan kehitettyjen artefaktien suorituskykyä ja ominaisuuksia.
Tulokset osoittivat, että artefakti pystyi jossain määrin ylläpitämään NPC-hahmojen tarinan laatua ja uskottavuutta.

Tulokset osoittivat kuitenkin myös joitakin keskeisiä parannusalueita: hallusinaatioita esiintyi kontekstuaalisista lieventämistoimista huolimatta, ja taloudelliset kustannukset olivat huomattavat, jos järjestelmää skaalattiin. Dialogin generoinnin viivettä onnistuttiin vähentämään parannetulla mallilla, ja hakujärjestelmä otettiin käyttöön hallusinaatioiden vähentämiseksi, mikä paransi NPC-hahmojen vuorovaikutuksen laatua ja luotettavuutta.

Tutkimuksen tulokset antoivat oivalluksia LLM:ien ja RAG:in potentiaalista, kyvyistä ja haasteista pelikehityksessä. Tulevaa tutkimusta suositellaan kustannusten ja viiveen optimoimiseksi edelleen sekä uusien menetelmien ja parannusten kehittämiseksi NPC-dialogien hallusinaatioiden vähentämiseksi.},

This paper reviews existing non-player character dialogue systems and emphasizes the need to generate dynamic, context-sensitive dialogs. The capabilities of large language models, especially GPT-3 and GPT-4, in generating coherent, contextually relevant content are explored. In this paper, I propose a framework for non-player role dialog based on large language model. The framework includes key components such as intent recognition, memory retrieval, dialog management, and response generation. The framework was tested in practice in the text-based role-playing game Call of Cthulhu. Evaluations from game participants indicated that the dialog based on the large language model was more natural and contextualized, enhancing the overall game experience.

This study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of integrating large language models into non-player character dialog systems, providing valuable exploration and practice for developing smarter and more responsive game characters. However, there are still challenges in managing long-term memory and context in non-player character dialog systems based on large language models, which require further research.},

Dialogue serves as the primary means of communication between developers and players, manifesting in various forms such as guides, NPC interactions, and storytelling. While most games rely on written scripts to define the main story and character personalities, player immersion can be significantly enhanced through casual interactions between characters. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a dialogue filler framework that utilizes LLMs enhanced by knowledge graphs to generate dynamic and contextually appropriate character interactions. We test this framework within the environments of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Pokemon, providing qualitative and quantitative evidence that demonstrates GPT-4's capability to act with defined personalities and generate dialogue. However, some flaws remain, such as GPT-4 being overly positive or more subtle personalities, such as maturity, tend to be of lower quality compared to more overt traits like timidity. This study aims to assist developers in crafting more nuanced filler dialogues, thereby enriching player immersion and enhancing the overall RPG experience.},

In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into “The Good” (beneficial LLM applications), “The Bad” (offensive applications), and “The Ugly” (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs’ potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.},

However, their extensive assimilation into various services introduces significant security risks. This study deconstructs the complexities and implications of prompt injection attacks on actual LLM-integrated applications. Initially, we conduct an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints of current attack strategies in practice. Prompted by these limitations, we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection. 10 vendors have validated our discoveries, including Notion, which has the potential to impact millions of users. Our investigation illuminates both the possible risks of prompt injection attacks and the possible tactics for mitigation.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4{\textbackslash}\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5{\textbackslash}\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have exploded in popularity due to their ability to perform a wide array of natural language tasks. Text-based content moderation is one LLM use case that has received recent enthusiasm, however, there is little research investigating how LLMs can help in content moderation settings. In this work, we evaluate a suite of commodity LLMs on two common content moderation tasks: rule-based community moderation and toxic content detection. For rule-based community moderation, we instantiate 95 subcommunity specific LLMs by prompting GPT-3.5 with rules from 95 Reddit subcommunities. We find that GPT-3.5 is effective at rule-based moderation for many communities, achieving a median accuracy of 64\% and a median precision of 83\%. For toxicity detection, we evaluate a range of LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini Pro, LLAMA 2) and show that LLMs significantly outperform currently widespread toxicity classifiers. However, we also found that increases in model size add only marginal benefit to toxicity detection, suggesting a potential performance plateau for LLMs on toxicity detection tasks. We conclude by outlining avenues for future work in studying LLMs and content moderation.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the academic integrity considerations of students' use of Artificial
         Intelligence (AI) tools using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in formal
         assessments. We examine the evolution of these tools, and highlight the potential
         ways that LLMs can support in the education of students in digital writing and beyond,
         including the teaching of writing and composition, the possibilities of co-creation
         between humans and AI, supporting EFL learners, and improving Automated Writing Evaluations
         (AWE). We describe and demonstrate the potential that these tools have in creating
         original, coherent text that can avoid detection by existing technological methods
         of detection and trained academic staff alike, demonstrating a major academic integrity
         concern related to the use of these tools by students. Analysing the various issues
         related to academic integrity that LLMs raise for both Higher Education Institutions
         (HEIs) and students, we conclude that it is not the student use of any AI tools that
         defines whether plagiarism or a breach of academic integrity has occurred, but whether
         any use is made clear by the student. Deciding whether any particular use of LLMs
         by students can be defined as academic misconduct is determined by the academic integrity
         policies of any given HEI, which must be updated to consider how these tools will
         be used in future educational environments.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the capability of LLMs in storytelling, focusing on narrative development and plot progression. We introduce a novel computational framework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story arcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and valence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40\% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.},
