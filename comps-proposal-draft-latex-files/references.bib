	abstract = {The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have inspired recent efforts to integrate LLM-generated dialogue into video games. However, evaluation remains a major challenge: how do we assess the player experience in a commercial game augmented with LLM-generated dialogue? To explore this question, we introduce a dynamic evaluation framework for the dialogue management systems that govern the task-oriented dialogue often found in roleplaying video games. We first extract dialogue from the widely-acclaimed role-playing game *Disco Elysium: The Final Cut*, which contains 1.1M words of dialogue spread across a complex graph of utterances where node reachability depends on game state (e.g., whether a certain item is held). Using this dataset, we have GPT-4 perform *dialogue infilling* to generate grounded utterances based on game state represented via code. In a statistically robust study of 28 players recruited from the r/DiscoyElysium subreddit, the LLM outputs are evaluated against the game designers' writing via both preference judgments and free-form feedback using a web interface that recreates the game`s core conversation functionality. Overall, the game designers' prose is significantly preferred to GPT-4 generations, with participants citing reasons such as improved logical flow and grounding with the game state. To spur more principled future research in this area, we release our web interface and tools to enable researchers to build upon our work. https://pl.aiwright.dev},

One application domain that could prove fruitful is to video games, where LLMs could be used to provide conversational responses from non-playable characters (NPCs) that are more dynamic and diverse. Additionally, LLMs could allow players the autonomy to converse in open-ended conversations potentially improving player immersion and agency. However, due to their recent commercial popularity, the consequences (both negative and positive) of using LLMs in video games from a player’s perspective is currently unclear. On from this, we analyse player feedback to the use of LLM-driven NPC responses in a commercially available video game. We discuss findings and implications, and generate guidelines for designers incorporating LLMs into NPC dialogue.},

We developed a murder mystery game where users interact with LLM-based non-playable characters (NPCs) through interrogation, clue-gathering, and exploration. Two versions were tested: one using speech recognition and another with traditional dialog boxes. While both provided similar social presence, users felt more immersed with speech recognition but found it overwhelming, while the dialog version was more challenging. Slow NPC response times were a source of frustration, highlighting the need for faster generation or better masking for a seamless experience.},

Structured around three phases-introduction, collaboration, and feedback-, the game uses large language models (LLMs) to simulate varying emotional states in NPCs, from neutrality to expressions of anger, joy, and more. Players’ emotional responses to the game play and interaction with the NPCs are captured through the dialogue they input. Language models are used to extract emotion scores from these in-game conversations. This study aims to enhance our understanding of emotional dynamics within gaming environments, in order to further inform the design of emotionally engaging experiences. Additionally, it underscores the potential of language models for scientific inquiries in human-computer interaction.},

Tutkimuksen tavoitteisiin kuului kehittää mukautuvia ja asiayhteyden ymmärtäviä NPC-hahmoja, mitata NPC-hahmojen kykyä ylläpitää immersiota, LLM:ien vaikutusta tarinaan ja NPC-hahmojen uskottavuuteen, mitata laskennallisia ja taloudellisia kustannuksia, mitata dialogin generoinnin viivettä sekä vähentää NPC-dialogien hallusinaatioita.

Tutkimuksessa käytettiin Design Science Research (DSR) -metodologiaa, jossa ensiksi tunnistettiin ongelma ja seuraavaksi artefaktien suunnittelulla ja arvioinnilla. Järjestelmäarkkitehtuuri sisälsi tiedonkulun ja -hallinnan, hakujärjestelmät ja generointijärjestelmät, tietojen säilyttämisen ja haun. Arviointityökalut integroitiin mittaamaan kehitettyjen artefaktien suorituskykyä ja ominaisuuksia.
Tulokset osoittivat, että artefakti pystyi jossain määrin ylläpitämään NPC-hahmojen tarinan laatua ja uskottavuutta.

Tulokset osoittivat kuitenkin myös joitakin keskeisiä parannusalueita: hallusinaatioita esiintyi kontekstuaalisista lieventämistoimista huolimatta, ja taloudelliset kustannukset olivat huomattavat, jos järjestelmää skaalattiin. Dialogin generoinnin viivettä onnistuttiin vähentämään parannetulla mallilla, ja hakujärjestelmä otettiin käyttöön hallusinaatioiden vähentämiseksi, mikä paransi NPC-hahmojen vuorovaikutuksen laatua ja luotettavuutta.

Tutkimuksen tulokset antoivat oivalluksia LLM:ien ja RAG:in potentiaalista, kyvyistä ja haasteista pelikehityksessä. Tulevaa tutkimusta suositellaan kustannusten ja viiveen optimoimiseksi edelleen sekä uusien menetelmien ja parannusten kehittämiseksi NPC-dialogien hallusinaatioiden vähentämiseksi.},

	abstract = {Traditional non-player character dialog systems rely on preset lines, which lack realism and dynamics and reduce player immersion. This study aims to explore overcoming these limitations through large language models.

This paper reviews existing non-player character dialogue systems and emphasizes the need to generate dynamic, context-sensitive dialogs. The capabilities of large language models, especially GPT-3 and GPT-4, in generating coherent, contextually relevant content are explored. In this paper, I propose a framework for non-player role dialog based on large language model. The framework includes key components such as intent recognition, memory retrieval, dialog management, and response generation. The framework was tested in practice in the text-based role-playing game Call of Cthulhu. Evaluations from game participants indicated that the dialog based on the large language model was more natural and contextualized, enhancing the overall game experience.

This study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of integrating large language models into non-player character dialog systems, providing valuable exploration and practice for developing smarter and more responsive game characters. However, there are still challenges in managing long-term memory and context in non-player character dialog systems based on large language models, which require further research.},

Dialogue serves as the primary means of communication between developers and players, manifesting in various forms such as guides, NPC interactions, and storytelling. While most games rely on written scripts to define the main story and character personalities, player immersion can be significantly enhanced through casual interactions between characters. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a dialogue filler framework that utilizes LLMs enhanced by knowledge graphs to generate dynamic and contextually appropriate character interactions. We test this framework within the environments of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Pokemon, providing qualitative and quantitative evidence that demonstrates GPT-4's capability to act with defined personalities and generate dialogue. However, some flaws remain, such as GPT-4 being overly positive or more subtle personalities, such as maturity, tend to be of lower quality compared to more overt traits like timidity. This study aims to assist developers in crafting more nuanced filler dialogues, thereby enriching player immersion and enhancing the overall RPG experience.},
